Module-9 Assignment Solution


1. Conditional Operators in Java:
   * The conditional (ternary) operator is ?:. It is used as a shorthand for the if-else statement.
2. Types of Operators Based on the Number of Operands:
   * Unary Operators: Operate on a single operand (e.g., ++, --).
   * Binary Operators: Operate on two operands (e.g., +, -, *, /).
   * Ternary Operators: Operate on three operands (e.g., ?:).
3. Use of Switch Case in Java Programming:
   * The switch statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed. It works with byte, short, char, int, String, and enum types.
4. Priority Levels of Arithmetic Operations in Java:
   * The precedence of arithmetic operators is as follows:
      1. Multiplication (*), division (/), and remainder (%)
      2. Addition (+) and subtraction (-)
5. Conditional Statements and Use of Conditional Statements in Java:
   * Conditional statements include if, else if, else, switch. They are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.


6. Syntax of If-Else Statement:
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {   // code to be executed if condition is false}
7. Three Types of Iterative Statements in Java:
   * for loop
   * while loop
   * do-while loop
8. Difference Between for Loop and do-while Loop:
   * for loop: Executes a block of code a specific number of times. The condition is checked before the loop is executed.
   * do-while loop: Executes a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly executes the block as long as the condition is true. The condition is checked after the loop is executed.
9. Printing 1-10

public class PrintNumbers {
public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
}}
