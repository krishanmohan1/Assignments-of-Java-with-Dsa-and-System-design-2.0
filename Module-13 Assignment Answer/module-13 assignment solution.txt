Module-13 Assignment Solution


1. Default Value of Array for Different Data Types
* int: 0
* double: 0.0
* char: '\u0000' (null character)
* boolean: false
* Object references: null
2. Can You Pass a Negative Number in Array Size?
No, you cannot pass a negative number as an array size in Java. It will throw a NegativeArraySizeException.
3. Where Does Array Stored in JVM Memory?
Arrays in Java are stored in the heap memory, just like other objects.
4. Disadvantages of Array
* Fixed size: Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed.
* Lack of built-in methods: Arrays do not have built-in methods for common operations (e.g., adding, removing elements).
* Inefficient element insertion/deletion: Inserting or deleting elements can be slow because it may require shifting elements.
5. What is an Anonymous Array in Java?
An anonymous array is an array without a reference variable. It's used for immediate use without storing the reference.
sum(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4});
public static void sum(int[] numbers) {
   int total = 0;
    for (int number : numbers) {
        total += number;
    }
    System.out.println(total);
}


6. Traversing an array: For loop, enhanced for loop, Arrays.stream(), Iterator.
7. length vs length(): length is for arrays, length() is for strings.
